Drawing on the power of their own voice, participants provide a glimpse into life in their region and their personal connection to the ocean as only they can. Whether a Bajao fisherman in the Philippines who is adopting new approaches to feed his family, a cultural leader in Hawaii whose ocean stewardship originates at the summit of Mauna Kea, or an Unangan community in the Pribilof Islands who are tackling the effects of marine debris, each contributor not only challenges assumptions about what science looks like, but what its voice sounds like. Our aim, however, is not to “</span><i style=\"font-size: 18px; color: rgb(62, 61, 64);\">give</i><span style=\"font-size: 18px; color: rgb(62, 61, 64);\"> people a voice” —a phrase laced with arrogance as it assumes lack of agency by participants. Rather, we strive to turn the teller and hearer dynamic on its head. Instead of “telling” stories about the ocean, we start by </span><i style=\"font-size: 18px; color: rgb(62, 61, 64);\">listening</i><span style=\"font-size: 18px; color: rgb(62, 61, 64);\"> to those who have intimate knowledge and experience with it and then provide a platform so that others may hear and learn from them. By refraining from inserting our own voice, values or belief systems into the videos, we allow for a more holistic story to emerge.</span></p>",
