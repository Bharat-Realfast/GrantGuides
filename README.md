# GrantGuides

Community-based organizations are often small and scrappy with limited time and resources. They need funding in order to continue to serve their communities and oftentimes secure that funding through grants. Global philanthropic funding (https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/its-time-for-philanthropy-to-step-up-the-fight-against-climate-change) related to climate change is minimal compared with the scale of the challenge and securing that funding is competitive. Grant writing is a long and tedious process that is often not a staffed position at a CBO. There is also a considerable amount of turnover at these smaller organizations which means institutional knowledge often leaves with that turnover. The staff member writing grants needs assistance crafting their message and telling their story in order to write winning grants and secure funding. 

## Solution Overview 

### Epic
In order to write winning grants, as a grant writer, I need assistance assembling the necessary content and telling my best story. 

### Use Case
In order to repurpose content from my previously submitted grant applications, as a grant writer, I need a way to store and quickly access my past grant proposal content.
